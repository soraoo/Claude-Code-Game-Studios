# Path-Specific Rules

Rules in `.claude/rules/` are automatically enforced when editing files in matching paths:

| Rule File | Path Pattern | Enforces |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| `gameplay-code.md` | `src/gameplay/**` | Data-driven values, delta time, no UI references |
| `engine-code.md` | `src/core/**` | Zero allocs in hot paths, thread safety, API stability |
| `ui-code.md` | `src/ui/**` | No game state ownership, localization-ready |
| `test-standards.md` | `tests/**` | Test naming, coverage requirements, fixture patterns |
| `prototype-code.md` | `prototypes/**` | Relaxed standards, README required, hypothesis documented |
